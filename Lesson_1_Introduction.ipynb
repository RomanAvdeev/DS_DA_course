    "Data engineering is the foundation that enables data scientists and analysts to derive valuable insights from data. Data engineers build and maintain the infrastructure necessary for high-performance data generation and processing.\n",
    "The field of data engineering has evolved significantly over the past few decades:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Warehousing (1980s-1990s):** Focus on relational databases and structured data, predominantly using SQL. Storing data centrally for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Big Data and Hadoop (2000s):** Introduction of distributed storage and processing for handling large volumes of data (rise of Big Data).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cloud-based Solutions and data lakes (2010s):** Emergence of data-centric applications and cloud platforms like like Amazon Redshift and also the move away from data warehouses to more flexible data lakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modern Data Stack and focus on data science and AI (Present):** Cloud-native solutions, lakehouses, decentralised data platforms, handling both structured and unstructured data at scale. Preparing data for data science modelling rather than building data warehouses for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evolution has led to data engineering becoming a distinct and vital role in the data ecosystem, separate from traditional software engineering or data science roles, however, working closely together with these roles to create end-to-end data solutions."
